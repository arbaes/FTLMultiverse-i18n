	<text>You've arrived at the headquarters of Wentworth Innovations. An impressive cityscape is laid out before you, lush with life and architecture reminiscent of old-Earth decorum: this is the clear work of the Wentworth family without a doubt. Despite the importance of this location, security seems sparse when you arrive. Perhaps overconfidence has overtaken even the most vital aspects of Vance's illustrious life.</text>

        <event>
            <text>As you make way towards the distant, monolithic citadel that heads the city, your luck runs out, and your identities as Renegades are quickly discovered. You incur several minor firefights, but miraculously the only casualties are on the corporation's side. After an awkward stay in the crowded citadel elevator for some 30 floors, you find your way to the office of Mr. Cayden Stimly - Vice President of Wentworth Innovations, and your target. The shriveled prune of a man - the left half of his face bleached from the fires of a Theocracy Inquisition many decades ago, sits behind his elaborately decorated swivel chair, facing the maw of a giant window with a view of the entire city. The suffocating aroma of the man's perfume forces you to hold back an ill-timed gag.</text>

										<event>
											<text>In the meantime, your crew have moved about the room and are now quietly playing some form of playground game with their appendages to pass the time. Stimly reaches to his right and presses a button on his chair for the intercom, and calls for his secretary to bring him some water. She comes bustling in the room, gives you barely half a glance and walks past, hands him a glass, and waltzes back out without a word of your presence. Stimly barely even mutters a mention of gratitude and continues to stare absently out the window.</text>

													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Continue...</text>
														<event>
															<text>Stimly coughs and adjusts himself in the chair once again. At last, he gets up from his chair, walking over to face the window. Apparently unsatisfied with standing there for very long, he walks backwards perfectly in-line back to his seat, not once turning his head in your direction. Finally, the anguished but hushed groans of your crew convince you to make yourself known.</text>

Stimly activates his intercom and yells for his secretary to escort you out, but the subtle suggestion of the business end of your blaster convinces him to postpone your escort.</text>

	<text>A crimson Auto-ship appears from around a nearby moon, weapons already hot. Say what you want about W.I., but they sure keep tight security!</text>
	<text>"Renegade Warning! Renegade! Renegade Warning! Renegade!" The ear-splitting bleeps from the nearby Auto-ship remind you how much you hate that everyone calls you by that name. While murdering everyone who does in cold blood might not be the best option, you doubt anyone will complain if you blow up this Auto.</text>
	<text>"You thought you could hide. You cannot hide. I am programmed to be perfect at hide and seek. I have found every ship to ever hide in this system. My programming insists that I should be insulted at the thought that you could hide. I think I will kill you. Yes. The programming never lies."</text>
	<text>Just when you thought standard Auto-ships were enough of a plague, these Innovation Autos are even worse. At least for every one you fight, it's one less the fleet can use against you later.</text>
	<text>It seems there's no end to W.I.'s supply of crimson Autos to throw at you. You suppose this journey would be awfully boring without some fodder to plow through with your cannons though.</text>

	<text>A Rebel Elite approaches. W.I. likely called in some extra protection from U1 since this sector is so vital to the Rebellion. Unfortunately, that means you have some Rebels on your hands that you'll have to grind through!</text>
	<text>"Seriously? A Renegade? Here?! I was just about to head home, and suddenly you show up? You have horrible timing, you know that?" Though the Rebel could easily just leave, he seems to be preparing to fight. Some things never change.</text>
